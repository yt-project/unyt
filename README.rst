A package for handling numpy arrays with units.

Often writing code that deals with data that has units can be confusing. A
function might return an array but at least with plain NumPy arrays, there is no
way to easily tell what the units of the data are without somehow knowing *a
priori*.

The ``unyt`` package (pronounced like "unit") provides a subclass of NumPy's
``ndarray`` class that knows about units. For example, one could do:

    >>> import unyt as u
    >>> distance_traveled = [3.4, 5.8, 7.2] * u.mile
    >>> print(distance_traveled.to('km'))
    [ 5.4717696  9.3341952 11.5872768] km

And a whole lot more! See `the documentation <http://unyt.readthedocs.io>`_ for
installation instructions, more examples, and full API reference.

This package only depends on ``numpy`` and ``sympy``.  Notably, it does *not*
depend on ``yt`` and it is written in pure Python.
